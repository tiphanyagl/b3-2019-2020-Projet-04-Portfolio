          <p>I have a little pocketbook that I care with me everywhere I go. All the time. So whenever I wanna create, I can.</p>
          <p> In here, it is all completely free. It's okay to do ugly things. It is okay to do wrong thing. Everything is okay. This is my safe place. Where I can do and try anything I want without judging and hating myself. </p>
          <p>In here, what's ugly becomes pretty because it is true. Because it is spontaneous.</p>

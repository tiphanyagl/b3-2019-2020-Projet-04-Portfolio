    <h3> .·˚° FLYING WHALE °˚·.</h3>
    <p>If I look up at the sky, I might see whales, flying in the clouds.
    I have always loved whales.I think they are amazing, majestic creature. I wish
  there were also air whales, and that I could see them floating within the clouds,
meeting birds, getting closer from the stars.They would look after us all thead
time, especially when night falls in our arms.
They would protect us.</p>
<p>This is a Watercolour illustration I did, with glitters. 15x10cm.</p>

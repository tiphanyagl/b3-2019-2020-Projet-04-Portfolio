      <h3>富春江 ; fuchun</h3>
      <p>When seasons turn around a chinese city and its painfull hearts </p>
      <p>"Séjour dans les monts Fuchun" is a chinese movie by Gu Xiaogang. It was inspired by the huge Feng shui fresco wearing the same name. It is a very long movie (about 2:30 hours long) that shows the old China meeting the new one, coming from the last generations. It is mostly a contemplative movie in which we can see the beauty of the country as it goes through every season. </p>
      <p> It also relates the story of a family living through generational conflicts.</p>
      <p> With one of my colleague, we worked on a poster and a little book about this movie. We created the visual completely on our own by using different methods. First we created the typography. Then we created the poster structure by cutting papers with kind of wave forms and then we have stick the printed letters on it. We also add watercolour marks. Finally we disposed the papers on differents plans in order to take photographs of it. Then to finish, we add additional text on photoshop.</p>
      <p> To create the little book, we used every graphic elements we created to do the poster and we organised it in a dynamic way. The book is an accordion so when you open it completely, it becomes a huge fresco, just as the Feng Shui one that inspired the movie. </p>
